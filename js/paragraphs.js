    "Back in our grade school, three students were often found in the classroom’s corner, sipping from their juice boxes and in-depth of a conversation they thought was the biggest mystery of all time. Clad in perfectly ironed uniform, they were the top three students of their class and although they were only 9, they made ‘extensive’ research on their topic. I can recall they’d exchange comments about the pre-colonial Philippines, words like ‘uncivilized’ or ‘primitive’ were mentioned. Those three kids went on to believe that— their country being unrefined before its colonizers. Unfortunately, those three children are not the only ones that stood in utter belief and conviction of the common misconception of the pre-colonial Philippines",
    "Fast forward to the present day, one of those juice-sipping, uniform-wearing, and downright curious kids is in college and is majoring in History. As part of the curriculum, she was tasked to read Juan De Plasencia’s Customs of the Tagalogs; boy oh boy, she was wrong in so many things for so many years. Plasencia’s works provided solid evidence that the Philippines before the Spaniards took over, was not as barbaric as they claimed it to be. For instance, they had barangays led by a chief they call dato/datu. Moreover, a hierarchy was already established, with nobles, commoners, and slaves as the classification.",
    "The girl, as you may have guessed, is typing this essay. She honestly feels disappointed that she knew no better and she desires to go back to that corner, to her juice-sipping pals. Perhaps she could correct what had been exchanged— but then again, it’s all part of her history. She sits in her bed grateful that she was able to revisit and reevaluate a common misconception. At least now, she had learned and that embarks a new quest for knowledge.",
    "She notes the Marcos regime as a probable force behind the reluctance and hesitance of the Filipino scholars. Then-President Ferdinand Marcos was in total support of the Kalantiaw code, claiming the ‘decline of the glorious Philippine past after the Spanish conquest’. He called for a ‘stronger rule’, alas, this was a tool for his dictatorial reign. Furthermore, William H. Scott being American did not positively contribute to this situation, as he was a foreigner attempting to clarify native historical beliefs. (Justiniano, 2011)",
    "As much as this man needs to be eradicated in the list of credible Filipino sources, I cannot help but emphasize that this name should not be forgotten. He successfully convinced many Filipinos, not just the ordinary ones, but even the scholars, of the existence of Kalantiaw and his penned code. Paul Morrow may have stated it best, Marco was “Philippine History’s Greatest Con Man” and the same person lived a life so mysterious. (Buglas Writers Project 2018) What could have urged him to craft the biggest hoax that ever roamed the Philippine textbooks? Frankly, we can never get to the bottom of it all but from my perspective, it would be a safe guess that his intentions were not pure. Nevertheless, people like him should not be dismissed but rather, we should cement their infamous legacy in history. Jose E. Marco turned out to be a fraud and also a cautionary tale that will warn us, almost infinitely, to be mindful and critical of what we read.",
    "Perhaps this is where I wish to reiterate my main point of historians or scholars being powerful individuals, as they get to paint the image the future gets to see. Take the case of Marco and the Kalantiaw Code, a person with this inexplicable background gets to rewrite history for reasons we may never understand. Unfortunately, anyone can be a Marco. Hence, let us all be the Scott that our world needs."
